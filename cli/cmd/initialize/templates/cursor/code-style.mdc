# Code Style

This rule documents recommended code style conventions for Rill projects. The goal is readable, reviewable, and consistent SQL and project files.

## Naming conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names for models, sources, and metrics (e.g. `orders_daily`, `customer_dim`).
- Use snake_case for files and identifiers to match repository conventions.
- Prefer names that reflect content and grain (e.g. `events_hourly`, `transactions_raw`).

## SQL Style

- Use UPPERCASE for SQL keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN) and lowercase for identifiers where helpful.
- Avoid SELECT * except in early exploration; prefer explicit column lists for production models.
- Use explicit JOINs with ON clauses; prefer INNER JOIN over comma joins.
- Break long SELECT lists into one column per line for readability.

## YAML & Config Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) in YAML files.
- Group related configurations together and add comments for clarity.

## Comments & Documentation

- Include a short header comment at the top of model files describing purpose, inputs and outputs.
- Document non-obvious transformations with inline comments.

## Formatting & Linters

- Keep line lengths reasonable (wrap at ~100 characters) to help code review.

### Example header for a model file

--
-- models/orders_daily.sql
-- Purpose: aggregate orders into a daily grain used by downstream metrics
